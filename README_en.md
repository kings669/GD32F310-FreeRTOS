## Background

Take the time to participate in the [activities](https://aijishu.com/e/1120000000306632) organized by the `Jishu Community`.I wondered if I could copy some of the projects I've done on STM32, but I found that the `ROM` and `RAM` of this development board are relatively small, which is more suitable for some small projects.

Purpose of this repository:

1. Some methods above STM32 can be transplanted to GD32,and the basic peripheral drivers can be copied.
2. FreeRTOS will be used in this project.
3. Build BSP layer and Task layer.

MCU：**GD32F310K8T6**  
RTOS：**FreeRTOS v202112.00**
